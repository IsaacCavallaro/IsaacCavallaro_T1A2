        <p>This study helped earn Isaac a scholarship to attend the Artist in Residence Program hosted by Vijay Iyer, in Florida. Unfortunately due to COVID-19, this residency was cancelled. Here, Isaac was to present his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3derM24aH8&list=PL_8ivkkFZ1zl26CoUhRlgItFq0dXv8Njm" target="_blank">augmented drumset </a>compositions to Vijay and the other artists in residence for critiquing.</p>
        <br>
        <p>With the world changing effects of COVID, Isaac plans to take his studies blah blah by intergrating his tech etc</p>
