        <h1>Background</h1><br>
        <p> Isaac Cavallaro is an Australian musician with experience as a music director, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXuiSVVK5cM&list=PL_8ivkkFZ1zk04m7xzOuOB3AmPwNmMVkb" target="_blank">producer</a>, composer and <a href="https://isaaccavallaro.com/tutoring/" target="_blank">educator</a>, currently studying to become a software developer at Coder Academy. Between class, Isaac is completing his Masters of Music Research at Griffith Universityâ€™s <em>The Queensland Conservatorium</em>; exploring the processes of developing an idiolect for the augmented drumset by integrating the computer and midi keyboard to the traditional drumset. </p>
        <br>
        <p>This research helped earn Isaac a scholarship to attend the <em>Artist in Residence</em> program hosted by Vijay Iyer, in Florida. Unfortunately due to COVID-19, this residency was cancelled. Here, Isaac was to present his augmented drumset compositions to Vijay and the other artists in residence for critiquing. These compositions can be viewed in the link below: </p><br>
