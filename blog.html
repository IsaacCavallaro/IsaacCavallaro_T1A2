          <p>During my time subletting in NYC in 2017, I set myself a challenge to produce an idea a day. The objective was to primarily use sampled audio (including sounds I sourced from around the city) and to throw them together in a kind of “audio collage”. The challenge was to only allow one day to collect the sounds, edit them and then walk away. </p>

          <h5>April, 2021</h5><br>
          <p>In September 2018, I returned home to Brisbane after working full-time for Royal Caribbean International, travelling all over the world, working in a variety of roles including Musical Director, Assistant Musical Director, Band Leader, Guest Entertainer and Orchestra Drummer as well as DJ’ing private weddings on board The Allure of the Seas (2015 -2018).</p>

          <h2>Augmented Drumming</h2><br>
          <img class ="blog-images" src="/images/Augmented-Drumming.png" alt="Augmented Drumming">
          <br>
          <h5>April, 2021</h5><br>
          <p>In 2019 I commenced my music research at Griffith University. My project examines the integration of the MIDI keyboard alongside the Traditional Drumset (TD) and suggests that the continual renewal of technology has both shaped the TD and led to the integration of digital technologies. Using a practice-led research model along with action research, my research project offers TD practitioners new tools for developing a solo percussion practice using what I call the Augmented Drumset (AD). The primary aim was to develop an idiolect for the AD; achieved through playing, practising, and composing for the AD, devising six parameters, resulting in an iterative process termed the Augmented Drumset Iterative Cycle (ADIC).  </p>

          <p>Room 28 is the name of my small three by three meter music room. It is where I make music, teach privately and is where I conducted my music research.</p>

          <h5>April, 2021</h5><br>
          <p>Outside of drumming and educating, I also run and directs my self-titled solo electronic project, fusing my composition and drumming abilities, aiming to create silky pop melodies and experimental electronic textures. This music has been played on internationally recognised radio stations with his production skills receiving a number of positive reviews.  </p>
